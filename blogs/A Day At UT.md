# A Day At UT
I have been attending online school for around 250 days. 2000 hours in front of the computer.
I enjoy sitting at the computer as most of my interests are interacted with through a computer
but sitting in front of a computer in your room without seeing people can be a little hard.
So I found a solution!

On weekends I would walk around the UT Austin campus and enjoy the beautiful buildings
and foliage. I explored the buildings, trying to find one that wasn't locked to students
with access cards until I found the William C Powers student activity center. This was
a public-*ish* building with places to sit and do work. There was a large conference
room for online instruction with comfortable chairs and desks with outlets.

One night I decided to do a day of online school--at UT. I thought this would be a great idea
as I could be around more people while I am doing school while still having the flexibility
of not being in person. I was still able to get coffee throughout the day and I still
had the ability to get up and move around. I thought this was a great solution to my
social separation of online school.

I got up early in the morning to have coffee and get my bag ready with all my necessary
items and accessories for online school. I brought my fountain pen and notebook. I brought
my laptop and a charger obviously among a few other items. I was fully ready to go to UT
for a day.

I drove to the school at about 7:10 in the morning.

Once I arrived at UT I parked around the GDC (Gates-Dell Complex) and checked if it was open.
It was not. I fell back to the William C Powers Student Activity Center as mentioned earlier
and sat down at a table to start work. There were a few UT students sitting around me and
there didn't seem to be a problem. I don't think anyone would suspect somebody of being a
middle schooler at a University.

In between each period of my online instruction I would walk over to the GDC and see if it
was open as I had been there before and I was interested in walking in. It never opened and
at one point I observed a student walking in with an access card but since I am a middle
schooler in 8th grade I did not have such a card.

I really ended liking the Student Activity Center. I moved around the building walking into
the large conference room for online instruction. The comfortable office chairs were perfect
and that is where I completed my Integrated Physics and Chemistry period.

Once it was 12:00 (essentially the start of my lunch period), lunch was a hard to obtain thing
at the UT campus. The restaurants inside the Student Activity center looked long-closed and
there wasn't anything on campus so I walked to the target across from the water fountain.
There was a really good Halal food truck nearby and I got a Gyro. I then walked to the Yogurt bowl
shop in the Gregory Gymnasium and got a Gatorade. I finished my lunch in the student activity
center before my last period.

Once I had finished my last period I grabbed an iced coffee at the Starbucks and relaxed for a
little while before my advisory period. After my advisory period I worked on the core backend
for the web log that you are reading this article on. Once it was 4:00 I clicked on the LASA
high school Hack Club zoom link and had a nice club meeting. I really enjoy clubs!

After the club ended it was 5:00 and I was very tired. I had a full day of learning and walking
around the campus. I really enjoyed changing up my location and I would highly recommend doing
the same if you are a middle school or high school student currently attending online school.
